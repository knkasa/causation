1. Run chi square test to all feature combinations.
  chi_square(X='A', Y='B', Z=['C', 'D'], data=data, significance_level=0.05)
2. Once it's done, look for V structure.  
  If X and Z are marginally independent, but become dependent when we condition on Y, then Y must be a collider, and the edges are oriented as X -> Y <- Z.
3. Use Meeks rule to orient the rest of diagram.
  If you have:
  A → B — C
  and A and C are not connected
  → Then orient: B — C as B → C
  (to avoid creating a new v-structure at B)
